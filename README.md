# ol-kit meets Google Places Search

This is a demonstration of how to integrate google places search into [ol-kit](https://github.com/MonsantoCo/ol-kit). Note that you will need to create an account with Google and get an API key. Be sure to turn on all location based permissions. You can find instructions on how to do that [here](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)
